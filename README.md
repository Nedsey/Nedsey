Hello! I'm Nedsey, a beginner developer. 
I currently make whatever programs that I feel would be fun to make and put them on here for safekeeping.
I'm intermediate? (still pretty bad) at Python and a beginner in Java development.

I love to work on raspberry pi projects and things that fly, such as RC drones, helicopters and planes. I am currently working on getting a private pilot lisense.
I also do HackTheBox, and i'm currently training to get my OSCP certification hopefully within the next couple years. 
I'm also learning computer science and some electrical stuff.

Thank you for checking out my profile! I hope you found something useful!
